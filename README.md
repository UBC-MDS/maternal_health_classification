# About
In this project we are comparing multiple classification models to predict pregnant womens' maternal health risk as low, medium or high from their health data. With our chosen model
we aim to identify some key indicators that predict higher maternal health risk. In rural communities faced with insufficient medical care having a predictive model to predict their 
maternal health risk from minimally invasive health data could be greatly beneficial in improving health outcomes for mothers and babies alike.
After some initial exploration of classification models we settled on the Decision Tree algorithm for its easily interpretable model and relatively high accuracy score. 
Based on this Decision Tree model some key indicators of increased maternal health risk are: **{Need to fill in afterwards}**
While this is a great first step the model accuracy was not fully accurate, and given the importance of accuracy in this context more research and modelling should be done before deploying this technology in rural communities.

The dataset used in this project was created by **{Need to fill in}** . The dataset was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Dua and Graff 2017) and can be found [here](url), or more specifically [this file](url).
